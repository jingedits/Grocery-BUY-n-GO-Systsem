       Grocery Store BUY'n GO System
===========================================
This is a basic Python grocery store application.  
Using their budget, users can view products, add items to a cart, and check out.  
The application uses CSV files to store product and order data.

           WHAT THIS PROGRAM CAN DO
===========================================
✓ Load grocery items from a file  
✓ Let customers enter their name and money  
✓ Show available products  
✓ Add products to cart (with stock check)  
✓ View and remove items from cart  
✓ Checkout and save the order to a file  
✓ If the cart is empty, the program tells the user  
✓ Object-Oriented design (uses classes)

===========================================
           FILES YOU NEED
===========================================
1. `main.py` – The main Python program  
2. `grocery_list.csv` – A file with grocery items


===========================================
         HOW TO USE IT
===========================================
1. Choose "Customer" in the main menu  
2. Type your name and budget  
3. View products and add items by typing the product code  
4. Check or change your cart  
5. Checkout to save your order  
6. Your balance is updated, and your cart is cleared

===========================================
           REMINDERS
===========================================
- Product codes should be 3-digit numbers (like 101, 102)  
- If a product is out of stock, you can’t add it  
- You need enough money to checkout  
- If no items are in the cart, it will say "Your cart is empty"
